# Building For Production

To build a complete application optimized for production, run:

```text
./gradlew clean zip                   (on Linux)
gradlew.bat clean zip                 (on Windows)
```

The package containing all of application files will be saved as `build/libs/template-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`.
