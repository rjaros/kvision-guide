# UI Structure

A KVision application is built with components and containers. A container can be a parent of one or more components (called children) and its purpose is to lay out children in some type of order. Every container is a component as well, so it can be a child of another container.

You can instantiate any KVision component and set any of its properties, but the component won't be rendered on the page until it is added to a container (exception: [Modals](../3.-optional-ui-functionality-via-modules/bootstrap/windows-and-modals.md)). Of course this container has to be a child of another container and so on until the [Root container](root-container.md).

## Component

The main interface for a component is `io.core.Component`. It declares `parent` and `visible` properties and some universal methods for all components.

{% code title="Component.kt" %}
```kotlin
interface Component {
    var parent: Container?
    var visible: Boolean
    fun addCssClass(css: String)
    fun removeCssClass(css: String)
    fun getElement(): HTMLElement?
    ...
}
```
{% endcode %}

The base class for all components is `io.kvision.core.Widget`. All KVision visual components inherit (directly or indirectly) from the `Widget` class.

## Container

The main interface for a container is `io.kvision.core.Container`. It declares the methods to manage container's children.

{% code title="Container.kt" %}
```kotlin
interface Container : Component {
    fun add(child: Component)
    fun add(position: Int, child: Component)
    fun addAll(children: List<Component>)
    fun remove(child: Component)
    fun removeAt(position: Int)
    fun removeAll()
    fun disposeAll()
    fun getChildren(): List<Component>
    ...
}
```
{% endcode %}

KVision offers a lot of different containers and they can implement other methods to add or remove children.

## DSL builders

Components can be added to containers explicitly, by calling appropriate methods (`add`, `addAll`), or by using DSL builders based on extension functions. Both ways allow you to get the reference of the created component for further use.

### Explicit calls

```kotlin
val panel = HPanel(spacing = 20, alignItems = AlignItems.CENTER).apply {
    add(Span("A label."))
    val button = Button("Click me")
    add(button)
    // do something with a Button instance
}
```

### DSL

```kotlin
hPanel(spacing = 20, alignItems = AlignItems.CENTER) {
    span("A label.")
    val button = button("Click me")
    // do something with a Button instance
}
```

As you can see from the above example KVision defines extension functions with names matching the component classes with a first character lower case (e.g. `HPanel` -> `hPanel`, `Span` -> `span`, `Button` -> `button`). These functions takes the same parameters as the primary constructors, their receiver is `io.kvision.core.Container` and they are returning the reference to the created object instance.

The DSL builders allow you to use only basic `add` method of the `Container` interface. If you want to use any of the specialized add methods of different containers you have to use dedicated DSL methods, provided by some of the containers:

```kotlin
dockPanel {
    left {
        vPanel {
            width = 80.px
            height = 100.perc
        }
    }
    down {
        hPanel {
            height = 60.px
            width = 100.perc
        }
    }
    center {
        canvas(510, 320)
    }
}
```

You can also always just call the appropriate methods explicitly.

```kotlin
dockPanel {
    VPanel {
        width = 80.px
        height = 100.perc
    }.also {
        add(it, Side.LEFT) // Explicit call of the specialized add method of DockPanel
    }
    HPanel {
        height = 60.px
        width = 100.perc
    }.also {
        add(it, Side.DOWN) // Explicit call of the specialized add method of DockPanel
    }
    canvas(510, 320)
}
```
