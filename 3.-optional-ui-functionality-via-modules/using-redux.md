# Using Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a popular predictable state container for JavaScript. You can use the full power of Redux in your KVision applications by adding the kvision-redux module to your `build.gradle.kts` file. This module contains a dedicated implementation of `ReduxStore` backed by the original JS library.

{% hint style="info" %}
KVision has built-in support for [Redux DevTools Extension](https://www.ngxs.io/plugins/devtools). Just install the extension for your browser and you can easily monitor and debug your Redux based application.  &#x20;
{% endhint %}

### State

The state of the application is hidden inside the Redux store. It can not be modified from outside. The only way to change the state is to use the actions and the reducer function.

It's recommended to use a data class to represent the state.

```kotlin
data class MyState(val content: String, val counter: Int)
```

### Actions

Actions are used to describe the possible changes of the state. Actions are represented as classes and they can contain additional data.

An action class have to inherit (directly or indirectly) from `io.kvision.redux.RAction`. It's recommended to use a sealed class, to be able to easily use  exhaustive `when` expression.

```kotlin
sealed class MyAction : RAction {
    object Increment : MyAction()
    object Decrement : MyAction()
    data class SetContent(val content: String) : MyAction()
}
```

### Reducer function

The reducer function actually changes the state. It is called after an action is dispatched to the store. A reducer is a pure function, that gets the current state and action, and calculates the new state of the application.&#x20;

```kotlin
fun myReducer(state: MyState, action: MyAction): MyState = when (action) {
    is MyAction.Increment -> {
        state.copy(counter = state.counter + 1)
    }
    is MyAction.Decrement -> {
        state.copy(counter = state.counter - 1)
    }
    is MyAction.SetContent -> {
        state.copy(content = action.content)
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: You should not mutate the state parameter. It's recommended to use immutable data types.
{% endhint %}

### Store

You create a Redux store with a `createReduxStore` function, passing the reducer function reference and the initial state of the application.

```kotlin
val store = createReduxStore(::myReducer, MyState("Hello World!", 0))
```

You can get the current state with a `getState` method.

```kotlin
val currentState: MyState = store.getState()
```

### Dispatching actions

To change the state of the application you have to use the `dispatch` method of the store object.

```kotlin
store.dispatch(MyAction.Increment)
store.dispatch(MyAction.SetContent("Welcome to KVision!"))
println(store.getState()) // MyState("Welcome to KVision!", 1)
```

KVision comes with [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) middleware already installed, and you can also dispatch functions, so called "action creators", which get `dispatch` and `getState` functions as parameters. This is the recommended way to dispatch actions asynchronously.&#x20;

```kotlin
store.dispatch { dispatch, getState ->
    window.setTimeout({
        dispatch(MyAction.Increment)
    }, 1000)
}
```

### Subscribing to the store

Any part of your application can be notified about the new state of the Redux store. You can use the `subscribe` method of the store for that purpose.

```kotlin
store.subscribe { state ->
    println(state)
}
```

### State binding

To help you describe the relationship between the state of the Redux store and the appearance of the application, KVision allows you to bind the store state with a content of any container. By using the `bind` extension function, you can use standard KVision DSL builders to easily represent the UI as the function of the state. The container content will be automatically refreshed after the state of the application changes.

```kotlin
hPanel(spacing = 10).bind(store) { state ->
    for (i in 1..state.counter) {
        div(state.content)
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: You can have multiple containers bound to the same Redux store. You can also create and use multiple stores, although this is not considered a good practice.
{% endhint %}

### Using additional middleware

You can use any Redux [middleware](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem#middleware) with KVision. You just have to add a correct npm dependency to your `build.gradle.kts`.

```groovy
sourceSets["main"].dependencies {
    implementation(npm("redux-logger", "3.0.6"))
}
```

Then create a middleware object with `require()` function and pass it to the `createStore` function (as a last, vararg parameter).

```kotlin
val reduxLogger = require("redux-logger").default
val store = createReduxStore(::myReducer, MyState("Hello World!", 0), reduxLogger)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Different middleware can have different ways and options of creating their main objects.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The middleware will not work with the Kotlin object, but with the internal state of the JS Redux store.
{% endhint %}

### Using ReduxKotlin

[ReduxKotlin](https://reduxkotlin.org/) is a multiplatform Kotlin library, created from scratch as a port of the JavaScript Redux. KVision contains the kvision-redux-kotlin module, based on this Kotlin library, which is almost fully interchangable with kvision-redux module and gives you very similar API. There are some pros and cons of using ReduxKotlin library, though.

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                                           | Cons                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <ul><li>full compatibility with Kotlin classes</li><li>smaller resulting bundle size</li><li>multiplatform support (ability to share Redux code between client and server modules)  </li></ul> | <ul><li>no support for Redux DevTools Extension</li><li>small ecosystem of existing extensions (compared to original JavaScript Redux)</li></ul> |

{% hint style="info" %}
When using kvision-redux-kotlin module you should be using `createTypedReduxStore` function for creating your redux store (instead of `createReduxStore`, which is available but deprecated since KVision 6.1.2).
