# 4. Integrating With Javascript Libraries

You're in a safe space, and we know how you probably feel about Javascript. That said, there are thousands of great Javascript \(and Typescript\) libraries out there which can accelerate your application's development. While KVision doesn't provide much in the way of specific functionality for integrating libraries, this chapter exists to keep this guide as comprehensive as we can make it.

Several chapters of the kotlinjs docs are worth attention when integrating with libraries:

* [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-interop.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-interop.html)
* [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/dynamic-type.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/dynamic-type.html)
* [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/using-packages-from-npm.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/using-packages-from-npm.html)
* [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-modules.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-modules.html)
* [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-external-declarations-with-dukat.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-external-declarations-with-dukat.html)

This chapter is very much a work in progress, but we'll build on this material to help you integrate with a wide variety of third party libraries.
