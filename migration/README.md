# Migration

Check this page when upgrading to a new version of KVision. Any backwards-incompatibilities will be described here. This is an evolving framework and things may change as refactorings and improvements take place, but we aim to keep the core as stable as possible.

Check [Migration guide for KVision 5.0.0](migration-from-4.x-to-5.x.md).

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 4.7.0:

* You need to upgrade Kotlin to 1.5.10.
* Due to changes in `webpack-dev-server` you need to modify `DevServer` options in your `build.gradle.kts` file.  Please replace:
  * `proxy = mapOf(...)` with `proxy = mutableMapOf(...)`
  * `contentBase = listOf(...)` with `static = mutableListOf(...)`

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 4.5.0:

* You need to upgrade Kotlin to 1.5.0 and serialization to 1.2.0 in your project `gradle.properties`.&#x20;
* Webpack used internally by Kotlin/JS plugin was upgraded to 5.x. You need to adjust any custom configuration in your `webpack.config.d` directory. Please use these [bootstrap.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjaros/kvision-examples/master/template/webpack.config.d/bootstrap.js), [css.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjaros/kvision-examples/master/template/webpack.config.d/css.js) and [file.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjaros/kvision-examples/master/template/webpack.config.d/file.js) files as examples. You can find more information [here](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/).
* `kvision-onsenui-css` module was removed and integrated with `kvision-onsenui` module.
* When developing full-stack application with Spring Boot 2.4.5, you need to add this snippet to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```
extra["kotlin.version"] = "1.5.0"
extra["kotlin-coroutines.version"] = "1.5.0-RC"
```

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 4.1.0:

* DSL builder functions have been annotated with `@DslMarker` annotation, which provides [strict scope control](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html#scope-control-dslmarker) over implicit receivers. It can lead to compile errors for existing code with hard to notice bugs. Sometimes it may also be necessary to specify the receivers explicitly.
* Routing functionality has been externalized to optional modules. If your application uses built-in KVision routing, you need to add `kvision-routing-navigo` module to your dependencies and call `Routing.init()` at the beginning of your `Application.start()` method.

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 4.0.0:

* Artifacts publication has been moved to Maven Central under new maven coordinates with `io.kvision` group identifier. You have to update all KVision dependencies in your `build.gradle.kts`.
* All package names have been renamed with `io.kvision` prefix. You should replace your sources in the following order:
  * `pl.treksoft.navigo` with `io.kvision.navigo`
  * `pl.treksoft.jquery` with `io.kvision.jquery`
  * `pl.treksoft.kvision` with `io.kvision`
* Make sure you are not using any deprecated code before migrating. All methods, classes and functions deprecated before version 4.0.0 have been removed.
* If you use web sockets with Ktor backend you need to manually install WebSockets feature in your `main()` function.
* If you use Ktor backend you should move `kvisionInit()` call to the end of your `main()` function.
* If you use `moment` module with locale support you need to manually `require()` all or some of the needed locales. You should also update `moment.js` file in the `webpack.config.d` directory from the current template.
* You should remove all Bintray repository addresses from your Gradle build files.

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 3.13.x:

* Due to changes in the Kotlin/JS gradle plugin for Kotlin 1.4.0 it is necessary to fix your `build.gradle.kts` file and `webpack.config.d/webpack.js` file. You can apply the following patch for `build.gradle.kts` file and just copy new version of `webpack.js` from the current template project (standard or fullstack, respectively).

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/kvision-3.13.0.txt" %}
Patch for build.gradle.kts file
{% endfile %}

* `Kotlinx.serialization` library 1.0.0 contains a lot of [incompatible changes](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/releases/tag/1.0.0-RC), so you have to migrate your code if you are using this library directly.&#x20;
* `Jed` was replaced by `gettext.js` library. You can safely delete `webpack.config.d/jed.js` file. You need to make sure your `*.po` files contain both `Language` and `Plural forms` headers.
* All flexbox and grid CSS properties and enums have been moved to the `StyledComponent` and the core package. Deprecated type aliases for refactored enums were added. Follow deprecation messages to remove deprecated types from your code.
* If you are using fullstack configuration with Spring Boot add `extra["kotlin.version"] = "1.4.0"` to your `build.gradle.kts` file.

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 3.5.x:

* Due to changes in the Kotlin/JS gradle plugin it is necessary to fix your `build.gradle.kts` file and `webpack.config.d/webpack.js` file. Carefully analyze [these changes](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples/compare/9a63de5933fd0ac385b5b41468c5006176407aa1..0dd57450cc37350780ea0febcf12fcdb90b3fe37#diff-0577060241e9967978e7e7039df0646c) for frontend projects and [these changes](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples/compare/9a63de5933fd0ac385b5b41468c5006176407aa1..0dd57450cc37350780ea0febcf12fcdb90b3fe37#diff-c6a77204309bf123278dd17c72f0b725) for fullstack projects.
* `Kotlinx.serialization` library 0.20.0 contains also some [incompatible changes](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0200--2020-03-04), so you have to migrate your code if you are using this library directly.

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 3:

* The `setEventListener()` method and the `onEvent()` extension function return now an `Int` instead of a `Widget`. The returned value can be used with `removeEventListener(id: Int)` method.
* The old, deprecated `setEventListener()` method without type parameter has been removed. Use `onEvent` instead.
* Problematic overloaded constructors for all css styling classes in the `core` package - `Color`, `Border`, `Background`, `TextDecoration and` `TextShadow` has been removed. Each class has only one, primary constructor.
* There are two new factory extension functions for the `Color` class. `Color.hex()` allows you to create a `Color` object from a hexadecimal `Int` literal. `Color.name()` allows you to create a `Color` object with an `Col` enum value.
* The dependency on the Pac4J library has been removed. The `p.t.k.remote.Profile` class has been removed as well. You can add Pac4J to your own project if you still want to use it.
* Jooby has been updated to version 2.x. You need to upgrade your application if you are using Jooby integration. See [upgrade docs](https://jooby.io/#appendix-upgrading-from-x).

This is the list of incompatibilities you may encounter when migrating your application to KVision 2:

* All DSL builder functions have been moved out of the companion objects to allow better auto-completion in IntelliJ IDEA. This change is incompatible with KVision 1 code. To migrate you should just remove code based on this regular expression: `[^\.]+\.Companion\.` from all your frontend code imports (Kotlin compiler will help you easily find all possible errors afterwards).
* The default font size in Bootstrap 4 is larger. You may have to adjust your application layout manually or use a [custom CSS theme](../2.-frontend-development-guide/themes.md).
* The direct child of the `Root` component is no longer 100% wide. Use `width = 100.perc` if you want it to be.
* The modules names have changed (the API of the components, package names, class names, methods and properties are mostly the same, with the differences described in details below).

| KVision 1 module name | KVision 2+ module name          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| kvision-select        | kvision-bootstrap-select        |
| kvision-select-remote | kvision-bootstrap-select-remote |
| kvision-datetime      | kvision-bootstrap-datetime      |
| kvision-spinner       | kvision-bootstrap-spinner       |
| kvision-upload        | kvision-bootstrap-upload        |
| kvision-dialog        | kvision-bootstrap-dialog        |

* Two new modules: `kvision-bootstrap-css` and `kvision-fontawesome` were extracted from the `kvision-bootstrap` module.
* The Glyphicons support is dropped. Use Font Awesome icons instead.
* The Font Awesome icon names require a style prefix (`fas`, `far` or `fab`).
* Components like dropdown, context menu, modal, window, progressbar, navbar, toolbar, responsive grid, tab panel, tooltip and popover were moved into `kvision-bootstrap` module.
* `ButtonStyle.DEFAULT` was removed. The `ButtonStyle.PRIMARY` value is the new default. New `ButtonStyle.SECONDARY` value is also available.
* `RadioStyle.DEFAULT` and `CheckBoxStyle.DEFAULT` were removed and are no longer necessary.
* The deprecated `Label` component was removed. Use `Span` component instead.
* `TableType.CONDENSED` was removed. Use new `TableType.SMALL` value instead.
* `ButtonGroupStyle.JUSTIFIED` was removed. Use a [different approach](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/#button-group).
* The `responsive` property of the `Table` component was removed. Use `responsiveType` property with a chosen enum value instead.
* The `dropup` property of the `DropDown` component was removed. Use the`direction` property with a `Direction.DROPUP` value instead.
* The `withCaret` parameter of the `DropDown` component constructor was removed. No replacement at the moment.
* `NavbarType.STATICTOP` was removed. Use `NavbarType.STICKYTOP` instead.
* Do not use `Tag(TAG.LI)` components when creating links inside `Nav` component. Use `Link` with `nav-item` and `nav-link` classes (or use `navLink` DSL builder function).
* When adding links to the `DropDown` or `ContextMenu` use `Link` with a `dropdown-item` class (or use `ddLink` and `cmLink` DSL builder functions respectively).
* `GridSize.XS` was removed from the `ResponsiveGridPanel` component.
* The `buttonsType` is no longer a var property in the `Spinner` and the `SpinnerInput` components (changing its value didn't work anyway ;-)
* The `DateTime` and `DateTimeInput` components are based on a new version of bootstrap-datetimepicker. The `weekstart`, `todayhighlight` and`showmeridian` properties were removed. The `todayBtn` and `clearBtn` properties were renamed to `showTodayButton` and `showClear` respectively.&#x20;
* The `ObservableList` class was moved from `pl.treksoft.kvision.utils` to `pl.treksoft.kvision.state` package.
* The `StateBinding` component was moved from `pl.treksoft.kvision.redux` to `pl.treksoft.kvision.state` package and is available in the main KVision module. It also can be used with any data source implementing `ObservableState` interface (e.g. `ReduxStore` or `ObservableList`).
* The mapping of date and time classes between the client and the server code was significantly changed. The `pl.treksoft.kvision.types.Date` class is deprecated and not supported anymore. You should use `LocalDateTime`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `OffsetDateTime` and `OffsetTime` from `pl.treksoft.kvision.types` package instead. All of these classes are mapped to `kotlin.js.Date` on the client side, but to the corresponding `java.time.*` class on the server side. This way you can easily use new Java types in your server side applications.
* The `pl.treksoft.kvision.hmr` package was removed and is not needed anymore. All KVision applications should now extend `pl.treksoft.kvision.Application` class and are executed with new `startApplication()` function.
* `ReduxStore.subscribe()` method calls the callback function once immediately right after the registration.
* Service functions for `SelectRemote` / `TabulatorRemote` were changed to suspending. The function for `SelectRemote` component takes additional `state: String?` parameter.
* You are strongly encouraged to migrate your server-side interfaces common and frontend code with the help of the new KVision compiler plugin.
